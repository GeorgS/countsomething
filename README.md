## CountSomething

### Purpose

I wrote this react/redux application during my civil service in Austria. We had to fill in printed sheets about the amount of food/drinks we sold on a day and calculate how much is left in the kitchen and in the basement.
As I am trying to learn react and redux I did this little project to get familiar with these technologies.

### Run

First you need to download all the dependencies with `npm install`. To start the application just enter `npm start`, the page will be accessible at `localhost:3333`.
The state is stored in `store/state.json` and the clients sync trough socket.io.
